      "body": "It is the most common immunoglobulin. There're 4 subclasses of IgG that have subtle differences in the structure of the Fc. It's an opsonin. Opsonisation is an immune process that uses opsonins to tag foreign pathogens for elimination by phagocytes. Without an opsonin such as IgG the negatively charged cell walls of the pathogen and phagocyte repel each other. As for the intracellular pathogens IgG stimulates another kind of immune response called antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. It's a type of immune reaction in which a target cell or microbe is coated with antibodies and killed with certain types of white blood cells",
